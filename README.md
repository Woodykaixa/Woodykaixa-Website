# Woodykaixa Website

Refactor [my old website](https://woodykaixa.github.io).

## Motivation

### About my old website

My old website (Abbr. `old-site`) is my project for Web Design Course and deployed using Github Pages.  It has several
problems.

1. Github Pages serves my website as static files. I used react-router in old-site, however it causes 404 when I refresh browser.

2. When I develop old-site, I'm new to web development. There are many problems im my project. So I need a refactor.

3. To examine my css skills, I didn't use any UI framework. In fact, the UI of old-site is awful. And it's also hard to maintain.

4. Bad design everywhere.
